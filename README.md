# Exploration of 2017 - 2020 Atlanta Braves Pitching Statcast Data

## Description

Since I donned my first tee ball jersey, the Atlanta Braves have been my favorite baseball team. Given some free time during a COVID-19 induced, elongated winter break from my Master's program in Statistics at Duke, I decided to delve into some Statcast data to (1) keep my coding skills sharp and (2) learn a few interesting tid-bits about my favorite players.

I didn't enter this project with any specific objectives or research questions. Rather, I enjoyed exploring the data freely, posing questions that I encountered along the way, and synthesizing my findings (and potential next steps) at each stopping point.

In an attempt to limit the potential scope of my investigations (and keep the data to a manageable size), I used the following criteria for my initial data set:

- Atlanta Braves only
- Pitching data only
- 2017 - 2020 regular season and playoffs

The entirety of my analysis is accessible via the [html](https://github.com/robkravec/Atlanta-Braves-Pitching/blob/main/Pitching_Analysis.html) file in this repository, and I will also highlight a sample of my more visually appealing findings below.
